I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, 
and a BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like superheroes, puzzles, and similar to most basic people: hiking. 
Wordle is okay too, I guess. This is the way.

I am a senior in Computer Science and I eventually want to land a job 
in Game Development. I like finding ways to incorporate as much 
creativity as I can in CS. If I'm not playing video games or coding 
you can probably find me playing guitar. Peace.

playing video games, and playing dungeons and dragons. I have a cat 
named Jack and my girlfriend has two cats named Pickle and Fritz, so I 
guess you could say that I like cats.

Salomon Perez
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! My name is Salomon, I'm a comp-sci major and minoring in
mathematics. What attracted me to this major is th efact that, as time
progresses, computers have begun to become a more essential part of
society as a whole, and to put it bluntly, I don't want to be left
behind. I've recently gotten into fitness, and I play videogames when
I have nothing to do. I hope we both have a great semester.

I also enjoy talking to different types of people and having deep conversations
with them to see their perspectives on life.

Kenneth Alvarado
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am computer science major and I am currently in my senior year at UNCG. 
I transfered from RCCC which I graduated with my associates of science and 
took a gap year or so to decide what I really wanted to major in. I enjoy 
games, soccer, and working on my car(modifying it). I also like dogs but 
don't have one currently due to just not having any time to be able to give 
it the attention it needs.
